# Hi there, I'm Andrey

Python Junior developer 
21 y.o. 
I live in Krasnodar (Russia)

### Education

Graduated from 9th grade school
I have secondary-special education: <br>"Programming in computer systems " , 
but they didn 't teach anything there ,<br> so I started self - education

### In leisure time

In my free time I like to play computer and board games with my girlfriend, <br>watch videos on YouTube and Tiktok, and of course program in Python
